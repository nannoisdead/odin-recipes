    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Songpyeon (송편) is a must-have Chuseok delicacy. These small half-moon shaped rice cakes (tteok, 떡)
         are stuffed with sweet fillings such as sweetened sesame seeds and traditionally steamed on a bed 
         of pine needles. The name songpyeon stems from the use of pine needles, because “song” in
          “songpyeon” means pine tree.
